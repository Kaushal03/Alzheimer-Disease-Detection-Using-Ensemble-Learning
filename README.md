# Alzheimer-Disease-Detection-Using-Ensemble-Learning

<h4>In the proposed project, a unique system dubbed the Alzheimer Disease Detection System is introduced.</h4>
<h4>It makes use of deep learning models to precisely identify Alzheimer's disease.</h4>
<h4>The system uses CNN, Densenet, VGG19, and Efficient Net B7 among other 3D classification architectures, along with a registration-free preprocessing pipeline.</h4>
<h4>To decide if a specific MRI image is an AD, EMCI, LMCI, MCI, or CN, the best-performing models are put through an ensemble learning technique.</h4>
