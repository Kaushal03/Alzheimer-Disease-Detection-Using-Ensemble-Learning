# Alzheimer-Disease-Detection-Using-Ensemble-Learning

In the proposed project, a unique system dubbed the Alzheimer Disease Detection System is introduced. It makes use of deep learning models to precisely identify Alzheimer's disease. The system uses CNN, Densenet, VGG19, and Efficient Net B7 among other 3D classification architectures, along with a registration-free preprocessing pipeline. To decide if a specific MRI image is an AD, EMCI, LMCI, MCI, or CN, the best-performing models are put through an ensemble learning technique.
